About
=====

This is a Library for managing function a permanent subset for cleaning 
/etc/init.d and many distribution shell with doubtfull feature and poor
verbosity and documentation. 


Preface
=======

These are Common Bash-Object for Fnctlib _pre-Alpha-Init.d re-implementation 
for services management in Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora, which pass secessfully some handy-test 
in 3 years of developpement.
	

Description
===========

While bash start to offer more than conventional Shell, memory start to be very affordable, many
Boot-loader start to offer socket for Bash-like behavior and will be soon be part of Posix
conformance. Pre-Development from Command-line automation, and creation of Fnct_lib 
was a moderated Sub-API, a Wrapping in shell automate management and lead to well written version
introduced with fnct_debian_lib and linked sub-shell lib.


Synopsis
========
This will serve to generate development script and auto-creation-script for test purposes and automated
services for many U*nix and Linux environment. 

By The design, it will offer safe-container and safe method of transfering information in management
of services and will be able to perform gain in check-up in stable envirronement by skipping check
in Read-only mode of certains loading... Like, If RO-File-system is older than creation date, it will
be able to query OS to add trigger to perform less operation and load information faster in subsequent
startup... Idem with services with less touched file configuration. It will be able also to increase
oeuvrability of uncommon option like Disk-To-Stream accesibility and Memory-To-Stream Uses, aka
Network-Booting, Network Memory Pool and Network Application Ground-up.

Also , Methodology of implementation is strict and observe Object-oriented transcription in
transformation of many available Byte-coded of IDL re-interpretation in super-tiny scalling...

Certains option will be implemented in second-stage of developpement, and
creating wrapper for un-accessible Gpl-services or fast-implementation prototyping,
switch for DTD extraction of Shell-Application program and XML Verbosis and XML object induction to
help developpement of functionnality implementation in fnct_list .
